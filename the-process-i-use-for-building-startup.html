					<p>The reason I am writing this blog post is because I am a 28 years old person, who have already wasted many years of this life trying to build products that no one needs. And that happened all because I didn't know or even didn't want to know a must read theory of building successful startup.</p>

                    <p>Maybe this sounds too easy, probably I knew some parts of this theory but I couldn't connect the dots for two reasons: 1. No one explained me clearly why this theory is so important. 2. I was too ignorant person.</p>

                    <p>Anyway with some experience and hard punches in the past, I decided to write the formula of this theory in this blog post for myself and share it with you. I will call this theory like this: <b>what is the formula of effective and fast way to build a very successful startup</b>. </p>

                    <p>So let's dive in.</p>

                    <p><b>STEP 1.</b> Find what's missing in this world and for what type of customers. (Spend a lot of time on it, especially in the beginning)</p>

                    <p><b>STEP 2.</b> Decide what type of product you want to build and for whom.</p>

                    <p>- Check if a market you've chosen for your idea is good. (See if you can become friends and spend a lot of time talking with someone from your market and/or sell your product in advance.)
                            <br>
                    <b>IF NOT, GO TO STEP 2.</b> You either are not the right person for this market or the market simply does not want to be innovated.</p>
                    
                    <p>- Check if you can build this product in weeks or even days.<br>
                        <b>IF NOT</b>, think honestly if you want to take a risk.</p>

                    <p>- Think about are there any ways you can grow this startup organically or profitably.<br>
                        <b>IF NOT, GO TO STEP 2.</b></p>

                    <p>- Think realistically how this startup can become a billion dollar company. (Adjacent markets, proprietary technology, branding, network effects, defensibility and etc.)</p>
                    <p><b>IF NOT</b>, think if you really want to waste your time on something not very important.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>STEP 3.</b> Build MVP using strict timeboxes. Reduce the amount of features and other type of work instead of giving yourself more time to finish.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>STEP 4.</b> Find several potential users manually and show them MVP in order to get feedback.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>STEP 5.</b> Try to make them buy and/or use your MVP with high engagement for a long time.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>DOES IT WORK? IF NOT, GO TO STEP 2.</b></p>
                    
                    <p><b>STEP 6.</b> Try to pick 10-100 users manually and make them buy and/or use your product with high engagement for a long time..</p>
                    
                    <p><b>DOES IT WORK? IF NOT, GO TO STEP 2.</b></p>
                    
                    <p><b>STEP 7.</b> Try to find a way to grow organically and/or profitably</p>

                    <p><b>DOES IT WORK? IF NOT, GO TO STEP 2.</b></p>
                    
                    <p>IF EVERYTHING WORKS, YOU ARE VERY LUCKY!!!</p>
                    
                    <p><b>STEP 8.</b> On this step you have a product market fit. Now optimize a product for growth and build a team.</p>
                    
                    <p> This is the formula I use and will keep using in the future for building my own startups. <b>The faster I will go from one step to another, the more chance I have to become successful.</b></p>
                        
                    <p>I hope you've enjoyed it. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.</p> 

                    <p class="mt-5"><b>P.S.</b> For me personally, the <b>STEP 1.</b> and <b>STEP 2.</b> were the hardest, because I could find plenty of useful information about other steps, but not these two. 
                        And I really don't why is that so. Probably many of us don't know.</p>

                    <p>I strongly believe that the process of finding great ideas and deciding what things to build and for whom is a topic that is extremely underexplored.</p>

                    <p>I hope I will be able to give you more details about this topic in the future.</p>

                    <p class="mt-5"><b>P.S.</b> This article is just for education purposes, I am not reponsible for your mistakes.</p>
